# 📘 LeetCode Algorithm Pattern Repository (In Progress)

A structured, pattern‑driven collection of solutions to the **Blind 75** problems, implemented in Python.  
This repository is designed as a reusable reference for mastering algorithmic thinking through patterns rather than memorizing individual problems.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Solve and document the Blind 75 problems using clean, readable Python.
- Organize solutions by algorithmic patterns for fast lookup and long‑term retention.
- Provide clear time and space complexity analysis for every solution.
- Maintain a consistent, easy‑to‑navigate repository structure suitable for interviews, revision, and teaching.

## 🧠 Why Patterns?

Most interview problems fall into a small number of repeatable patterns.  
Recognizing these patterns helps you:

- Identify solution strategies faster  
- Adapt known techniques to new problems  
- Build confidence during interviews  

This repository focuses on those core patterns and how they apply across multiple problems.
